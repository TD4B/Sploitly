This is a simple script intended to automatically enumerate and gather more information about a target
we are already interested in over the network.

The script automate(s) the first stages of information gathering, enumeration as well as fingerprinting/probing and then outputs the data 
to a human friendly format so we can then come up with tactics for execution and exploitation. 

I have written this script primarily as a means to make my exploitation process more efficient as I need to be able to exploit as many machines as I can, in as little time as possible. Therefore, it is likely that this script may even turn into a sweeper type scanner. However for now, it is intended to be used on an invididual target.
